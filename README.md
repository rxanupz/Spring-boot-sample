## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Apache Maven or Gradle (for building the project)
- Salesforce account (for Salesforce integration)
- SQL Server database (for data storage)
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse)

## Setup and Configuration

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rxanoop/Spring-boot-sample.git
   


Import the project into your preferred IDE.

Configure your SQL Server database connection in application.properties or application.yml.

properties
Copy code
# SQL Server Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433/your-database
spring.datasource.username=your-username
spring.datasource.password=your-password
Configure Salesforce credentials and API settings in application.properties or application.yml.

properties
Copy code
# Salesforce Configuration
salesforce.username=your-salesforce-username
salesforce.password=your-salesforce-password
salesforce.securityToken=your-salesforce-security-token
salesforce.clientId=your-salesforce-client-id
salesforce.clientSecret=your-salesforce-client-secret
salesforce.apiVersion=52.0
Set your JWT secret key in application.properties or application.yml.

properties
Copy code
# JWT Secret Key
jwt.secret=your-jwt-secret-key

Authentication
The application uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. To access secured endpoints, include a valid JWT token in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests.

Salesforce Integration
The application integrates with Salesforce to synchronize customer data. The CustomerSyncService handles data synchronization between the SQL Server database and Salesforce. It can be triggered manually or scheduled to run at specific intervals.

SQL Server Integration
Customer data is stored in a SQL Server database. The application uses Spring Data R2DBC for non-blocking database interactions.

Additional Features
Additional features can be added as needed. For example, Swagger integration, error handling, and more can enhance the application's functionality.

Testing
Unit tests have been written to ensure the correctness of API endpoints and JWT token-based authentication. You can run tests using JUnit and Mockito.

Deployment
To deploy the application, package it as a JAR or WAR file using Maven or Gradle and deploy it to your preferred cloud or server environment.
